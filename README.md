# Homework-01: Code Refactor
First Homework Assignment: Learning Coding Development Tools, Languages, and Best Practices

This first homework assignment offered a "real world" simulation of the process of editing code for a simulated webpage to produce a more streamlined version of the code format without changing the look of the original webpage. Using the two basic web formatting languages of HTML and CSS, we utilized the tools of Visual Studio Code and ITerm in conjunction with various applications to attempt to adhere to Best Coding Practices to produce the desired result. We also learned how to create and maintain a Repository in GitHub, the indispensable and secure storage space where coders can generate ever-better versions of their work, receive useful feedback, collaborate with other coders, and share their work in a safe and user-friendly environment.

The initial version of the code for the webpages entitled "Horiseon" contained many redundancies nwhich would have hampered subsequent efforts to add to or recode the website, as shown on this Screenshot of the CSS code:

While being somewhat successful in eliminating some of the more obvious "div" redundancies, I was unable to reconcile my CSS and HTML files successfully, resulting in undesirable changes in the apppearances of the webpage. This will be a valuable experience moving forward. However, it was illuminating to read and try to emulate a professionally-produced README file such as the one for Visual Studio Code itself: Http://code.visualstudio.com. It was also invaluable to use GitHub, learning to push and pull versions of my file as my work progressed. I can see how valuable a collaborative tool it will be going forward.
